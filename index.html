    <ol type="1"><li>React was creted by jordane walke,a software engineering at facebook in the year 2011 and it was deployed first
    at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram.<br/>
    React is a open source front end js library.<br/>
   It follows the component based apporach for building reusable UI compoent speacilized for single page application and it is used for 
   developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.<br/><br>
 
       <li>Features of React?<br> One way data binding<br>
       Virtual dom<br>
       Reusable component<br>
       jsx(javascript syntex extension)<br>
       Performance</li><br>

       <li>Difference between class and Function component?<br>
            Class component uses the lifecycle methods where as in function component have hooks<br>
               functional component are also called stateless component while class component is called statefull component and there 
               is no render function there is return<br>
               function component accepts props as argument but props and state can be accept in class component<br>
               Functional component are easy to read as they have less code but the class component have complex code structure
               and hard to write<br><br>    

               <li>
                   stateless vs statefull?<br>
                   stateless component does not hold or manage state while statefull component can hold or manage state,
                   stateless component are easy to understand but the statefull component it is complex as compared to the stateless
                   component.stateless component does not work with react lifecycles but wheres statefull work with lifecycle method.
                   sateless can not be reusedwhile can be used in case of statefull component.Stateless component is also known as functional
                   component.Statefull component is known as class component.

               <li>What are the different phases of React components lifecycle?<br> In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. <br>These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:<br>
               1.	Initial Phase<br>
               2.	Mounting Phase<br>
               3.	Updating Phase<br>
               4.	Unmounting Phase</li>
